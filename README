A simple simulation of Earth's orbit around the Sun using
basic physics, Newton's law of gravitation and Velocity Verlet.

Rendered using Bevy game engine.

To Do:
- [x] clean the code a bit, maybe use more components and plugins to separate the rendering from physics
- [x] display a planet's orbit with line
- [x] display information like time scale, distance scale, revolutions, etc
- [ ] make it 3D with camera centered at sun and user can rotate/zoom viewport using mouse
- [ ] add "real" textures or use cool shaders to make it look cartoon-ish
- [ ] add earth tilt with "sun-side" shown
- [ ] add all planets from our solar system
- [ ] add GUI with options that you can tweak at runtime, like time scale, distance scale, toggle orbit lines, toggle quarters, etc
- [ ] recalculate each planet's orbit every nth update
